            Driving the car is bad for you, the people around you and the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cycling, on the other hand, gets you in shape, keeps the air clean for everybody and it is friendly to the environment.
            <br>Bonus: For trips under 5 km it is even faster in most cases!
        </p>
        <p>
            Make the streets of your city a better place now! Pledge publicly that you will no longer use the car for trips under 5 km.
